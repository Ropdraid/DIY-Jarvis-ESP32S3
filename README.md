# DIY-Jarvis-ESP32S3

WIP

Basically, this is Jarvis, all ran on different microcontrollers, rn im still looking into it. The ESP32S3N16R8 does main stuff, it listens, processes and sends it all
off to Groq. it processes it sends some data with json. there is so much stuff i cant even rlly like summarize it, basically its just an open source, very smart alexa.
So c3 does main AI stuff, the ESP32C3, is going to be in a 3d printer wall mounted thing, its gonna have a bowl with a button and gonna remind me to take my supplements,
then a display, that i can use to control my entire room, change settings and track stuff i have, like for example if i take out a module out of my storage i will log it and know later.
the the c6 is mainly for controlling other stuff, like my TV, my PC, and more. well thats about it, this is a very rough explanation and doesnt make sense, i know.
